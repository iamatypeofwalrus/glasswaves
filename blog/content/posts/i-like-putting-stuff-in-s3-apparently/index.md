[I like putting stuff in S3 apparently](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/how-to-export-an-amazon-dynamodb-table-to-amazon-s3-using-aws-step-functions-and-aws-glue/). I mentioned in my team's all hands about putting data out in S3 as a general architectural pattern that is always useful and Tomas reminded me that I've been on this train for a while.

Still [chuffed](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Chuffed) with my bio at the end of the article, btw:

```
Joe Feeney is a Software Engineer at Amazon Go, where he does secret stuff and heâ€™s quite chuffed with that. He enjoys embarrassing his family by taking Mario Kart entirely too seriously.
